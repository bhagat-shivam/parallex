#parallex-effect

over here only html and css are just

Rather than having moving graphics in the background, a parallax website has fixed images in the backdrop 
that you may stay in place while scrolling down the page to view various areas of the image.
Divide the whole page into three to four separate pieces and see how it works for you.
Create a parallax effect by using three or four background pictures, aligning the text for separate parts, adjusting margins and padding, and using background position and other CSS elements and attributes.
